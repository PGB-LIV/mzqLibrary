possible conflicting peptide identification cases:
Case 1: In a SpectrumIdentificationResult element, it could has two SpectrumIdentificationItem(s) with same rank="1" and passThreshold="true". This is rare but could happen when peptides have same scores because they contain Leucine and Isoleucine.  
Solution: Assign one sequence to peptideConsensus, annotate the rest sequences in userParam.

Case 2:
