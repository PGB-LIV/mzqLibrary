This routine is to normalise the abundance of peptide / protein group.The proposed algorithm is based on 
median absolute deviation (MAD). An optimised process is applied to reduce the effect of outliers.

It's constructor can be called from other Java routines.

The main parameters used are as follows:

(1) input file: mqz format
(2) output file: mqz format
(3) abundance level: peptide or protein
(4) output control variable name:
(5) assay quant layer ID: 
(6) input data type control variable accession
(7) output data type control variable accession: 
(8) quant layer type: AssayQuantLayer / RatioQuantLayer / StudyVariableQuantLayer (current version: AssayQuantLayer only)
(9) reference number: the assay number is used to be as a reference.
